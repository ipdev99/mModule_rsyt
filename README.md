## Replace System YouTube

**Magisk Module**  
_Simple module that will replace system installed YouTube_

### About
This module was written to remove the system YouTube that comes with Google's Android 11 Beta 3.
_YouTube v15.18.39 is the version packaged in Beta 3_

This is done by using Magisk to overlay the files in _/system/product/app/YouTube/_ with zero byte files.
